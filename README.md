## **üåê Deployment**

This application is deployed on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme). The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next.js.

## **üîó API Endpoints**

The application includes API endpoints for handling blob storage:

* POST /api/blob: Uploads a file to Vercel Blob storage.  
* GET /api/blob: Retrieves a list of all files from the blob storage.  
* DELETE /api/blob: Deletes a file from the blob storage using its URL.

Authentication is handled using Firebase Authentication, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user access. The withAuth higher-order component is used to protect routes that require authentication.

## **üé® UI Components**

The user interface is built with a combination of custom components and UI primitives from Radix UI and shadcn/ui. This allows for a flexible and accessible design system that is easy to maintain and extend.
